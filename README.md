# Library-Management-System
This is a console-based Library Management System written in C++. It allows users to manage a small collection of books (up to 100). The system supports the following features:

Add Books: Input a bookâ€™s name, author, and unique number to add it to the library.

Display Books: View all books currently in the library.

Search Books: Look up a book by its name.

Delete Books: Remove a book from the library by name.
The program uses structures and arrays and operates through a menu-driven interface in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit.
